	    <p>For the past 50 years, Empire State Health, home of the Vipers, has been a cornerstone in our community's educational and recreational landscape. Founded in 1974, our school started with a small group of passionate educators and volunteers committed to providing a nurturing environment for children to learn and grow.</p>

Our commitment to academic excellence has been unwavering, with many of our alumni going on to pursue successful careers in various fields.</p>
            <br></br>
	    <p>In addition to academics, we've always emphasized the importance of physical fitness and wellness. Our state-of-the-art sports facilities and comprehensive athletic programs have helped countless students develop teamwork, discipline, and a lifelong love for physical activity.</p>

Through a variety of extracurricular activities, community outreach initiatives, and support services, we strive to create a positive and inclusive school culture where every child feels valued and supported.</p>
